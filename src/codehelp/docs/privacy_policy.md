**Last updated December 28, 2024.**

This privacy notice for CodeHelp ("we," "us," or "our") describes how and why we might collect, store, use, and/or share ("process") your information when you use CodeHelp (the "Service") at https://codehelp.app/ (the "Site").


## Data collected and its usage

When you choose to log in to the Site using a link from your learning management system or via a social login (Google, Microsoft, or Github), you create an account on the Site.
This may give CodeHelp access to your personal information:

 * Your full name
 * Your email address

If you join any classes in CodeHelp, this personal information is used to identify you on the Site to instructors in those classes.

We may also store information you submit to the Site as part of your use of the Site (e.g., queries you make) in order to show you and instructors in your classes a record of your usage ("Usage Data").

We do not process sensitive personal information.


## Cookies

We use cookies solely for the purpose of providing the Service, specifically to enable us to connect you with your stored data.


## Third parties

We do not share any data with third parties other than for these purposes:

 * **To Provide the Service** -- We may share your data with service providers for the sole purpose of providing the Service.  For example, we may share data with those who host the Site or provide our email services.
 * **Class Instructors** -- If you join a class in CodeHelp via a link provided by your instructor, we will give them access to your Usage Data in that class, connecting it to your personal information for identification purposes.
 * **Academic Research** -- We may share aggregated and/or anonymized Usage Data with others for the purposes of academic research.


## Location of your data

CodeHelp is operated in the United States, and all data is stored and processed in the United States.


## Deleting your data

Any user can delete their account and associated Usage Data from the profile page.  The data is deleted immediately and cannot be restored.

Instructors can delete their classes and all associated Usage Data (including the Usage Data of any students within that class) from the configuration page for each class.  The data is deleted immediately and cannot be restored.

We will delete your account and your Usage Data two years after your last activity (creating an account, submitting a query, or a student submitting a query in a class for which you are an instructor).
